			<h2 div class="font-weight-bold" data-aos="fade-right">Experience going camping people often make mistakes</h2>
			<div class="line" data-aos="fade-right"></div>
			<p>Any upcoming trips should have a clear schedule and list all the items that you need to bring on the trip. Therefore, the experiences from previous backpacking and backpacking brothers are important tips that you need to prepare yourself better.<br>
If you are at the store and wondering what is the best camping tent to buy, you can buy it based on how many people you will share it with. But keep in mind that there is no single best standard when it comes to choosing a backpack for everyone. When going on a trip with friends or family, share supplies and items to set up a travel tent. However, if your trip is by car, don't worry about bulky things or weight, because everything can be put in the car and you don't have to spend too much effort on moving.<br/></p>
		
		<h4 div class="font-weight-bold mt-3" data-aos="fade-right">Mosquito</h4>
		<div class="line" data-aos="fade-right"></div>
		<p>It may sound like this is often not mentioned, but in fact, outdoor camping areas are always full of dangers from forest mosquitoes or dangerous insects. Imagine when you and your loved one are sitting by the campfire and talking. It sucks to go camping and the mosquitoes affect that wonderful moment. Some species can even be dangerous when carrying diseases that affect your body.</p>
		<h4 div class="font-weight-bold mt-3" data-aos="fade-right">Bring food</h4>
		<div class="line" data-aos="fade-right"></div>
			<div class="card-2  ">
  <img src="img/Capture-4.png" class=" card-img-top mx-auto d-block" alt="..." data-aos="zoom-in">
				</div>
		<p>Nature is not a perfect place and it is quite difficult for you to keep cooked food for a long time. And there are many insects like ants or other animals that can be attracted by the scent emanating from the food. Folding food containers are essential items that you can carry and store. Currently, on the market, there are Naturehike insulated containers that offer great heat retention. You can enjoy delicious and hot meals during a short camping trip.<br>

Some prefer to cook directly and use their own food cooked in a remote place. Then outdoor cookware from Naturehike with compact gas stoves are highly appreciated for being able to cook for many hours and saving fuel as well as being light in weight, without putting pressure on luggage when traveling. go far.<br/></p>
		<h4 div class="font-weight-bold mt-3" data-aos="fade-right">Prepare for the worst</h4>
		<div class="line" data-aos="fade-right"></div>
		<p>There is nothing more frustrating than going camping and manipulating the campsite. After a long day of walking, looking down at my feet and discovering painful blisters, it is terrible and affects the next movement and movement. Protecting your feet and especially from being stung, you can also minimize blisters thanks to the right trekking shoes and socks.</p>
			<h4 div class="font-weight-bold mt-3" data-aos="fade-right">
water</h4>
		<div class="line" data-aos="fade-right"></div>
			<div class="card-2 center-block">
  <img src="img/mat-nuoc-1.jpg" class="cangiua card-img-top"  alt="..." data-aos="zoom-in">
				</div>
		<p>Water is necessary in life and when moving, it consumes a lot of energy, which proves how important it is to carry water. However, for some people, they do not like the restriction and have to carry their belongings when camping on a long trip. Water filters can be compact accessories and provide enough water for you to use for many days. Do not think that the pure water in the creek or look clear, in fact can not prove that they carry any dangerous diseases.</p>
			<h4 div class="font-weight-bold mt-3" data-aos="fade-right">
Tent lights</h4>
		<div class="line" data-aos="fade-right"></div>
		<p>Ideally, you'll be camping and setting up your tent before the sun goes down. However, make sure you have lighting equipment ready. You may find a flashlight or a tent light is just what you need. It helps you operate in the dark. Some camping tents are designed with equipment and functions so that you can hang items and accessories on top such as margins more conveniently.</p>
